   menus (ex: main menu, highscore menu, options menu, pause menu, etc.)
-- Implement a group controller to control what scene is shown on the scene
-- Learn how to draw 3D shapes onto a javafx canvas

Time Log:
# Hours | Description
    2   | Spent by learning how to set up the intellij ide and
        | To figure out how to make the javafx library compatible with my laptop
    2   | Watching videos on how to use the javafx library. How to display scenes,
        | how to communicate across scenes, how to draw on scenes, etc.
   0.5  | Creating a 3D player model
    3   | Creating menu util to flexibly generate different menus using the groupBuilder class
        | that I also wrote. Groupbuilder will add different objects to a group and MenuUtil
        | will hold each group(menu) that is made in the class
   2.5  | Created a scene controller controls if the menu scene or the game scene is displayed
        | This also has functionallity to easily change the current scene
    1   | Started implementing mouse functions. On the menu the mouse will change
        | if it is hovering over a button. Added a function to center the mouse in the
        | center of the screen to be able to move the player view with the mouse.
    2   | Begin implementing OOP class to add objects into the environment. There is
        | a base object class that is extended by multiple other classes.

Current Total Time: 13 hours
