To Do List:
- moving and rotating the camera instead of the terrain
- map mouse movement. Find deltaX and deltaY on mouse movement to find
  mouse acceleration. Use this to find the amount the camera/player needs to rotate
- generate terrain functions in EnvironmentUtil
- movement physics to player
- add player hud pane/group to screen with health, ...
- set physics function with the physics class part of the object class.
    This affects all members of the environment that should be affected by physics
