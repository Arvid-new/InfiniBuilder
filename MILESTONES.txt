To Do List:
Features:
- add player hud pane/group to screen with health, ...
Camera:
- Implement Depth Checking on drawn objects so that they are rendered with the correct priority
Movement
-
Environment:
- Implement basic terrain generation using Simplex Noise
- Make Simplex noise terrain generation configurable
- Implement basic terrain generation using PerlinNoise
- Make PerlinNoise terrain generation configurable
Lighting:
- Add the ability to alter the different parameters and modes of Ambient Light
- Create a Day-Night cycle by using different Ambient Light colors


Menu:
- Improve menu to be more modular and OOP
- Move Main Menu cube to the right, make it bigger, make it rotate
- set physics function with the physics class part of the object class.
    This affects all members of the environment that should be affected by physics


Completed List:
- Fixed Ambient Light problem when returning from the main menu
- Added Fly Mode by pressing F;
- Added ability to jump a specified height
- Implemented Trig logic in order to move in different X and Z coordinates based on the current rotation of the camera
- basic movement physics to player (jumping, falling, etc)
- moving and rotating the camera object instead of the terrain
- Implemented PerlinNoise Algorithm helper functions and tested functionality to ensure it will work with terrain generation
- Added SimplexNoise library to use in the future for terrain generation
- basic generate terrain functions in EnvironmentUtil
- map mouse movement. Find deltaX and deltaY on mouse movement to find
  mouse acceleration. Use this to find the amount the camera/player needs to rotate
- Added simple terrain generation based on tiling cubes
